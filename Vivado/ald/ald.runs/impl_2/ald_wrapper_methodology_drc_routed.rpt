There is a large setup violation of -3.939 ns between ald_i/parameter_register_0/inst/parameter_register_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg1_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and ald_i/draw_bbox_0/inst/genblk1[0].bbox_i/r_b_reg[7]/R (clocked by PixelClk_int). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '4' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
